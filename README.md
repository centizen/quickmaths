A quick and dirty command line calculator for FFXIV. No need for any additional windows! 

More to be added here shortly. Addon will not be fully available until Dalamud goes stable after 6.35

When installed, just type "/pcalc" followed by the expression you want evaluated. Your answer will be written back to the system chat. 

Support brackets, decimals, basic arithmatic (+-*/) and modulous (%) operations.
