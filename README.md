![Math Tataru](images/icon.png?raw=true "")

A quick and dirty command line calculator for FFXIV. No need for any additional windows! 

Currently only available as alpha test, to install add the following custom plugin repository. Will be submitting to first party repo shortly.

When installed, just type "/pcalc" followed by the expression you want evaluated. Your answer will be written back to the system chat. 

Supports brackets, decimals, basic arithmatic (+-*/) and modulous (%) operations. 

Please open an issue if you have any problems, but really, it just sort of does what it says on the tin. There's not much to go wrong outside of version updates.
